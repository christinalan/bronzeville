# bronzeville

First iteration of a living atlas of Bronzeville, Chicago. This site was created collaboratively with Chandra Christmas-Rouse as a way to gather community members around a space that pushes forth a shared vision for the future of the built environment. The current site lives here: https://www.maplibsproject.com/
